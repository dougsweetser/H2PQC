    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Through any quantum computation, errors become present in qubits through thermal fluctuations, mechanical vibrations or other interactions between whatever the qubits are made out of and the environment around them. The state of the qubits then morphs into one that it was not supposed to be and ruins the computation further down the line. Because of this, the concept of quantum error correction is very neccesary to achieve future advancements in quantum computing. A question that may be raised is how does one correct for errors in qubits if they have to measure the qubits to see what the errors are. And if this is done, how is the state of the qubit preserved after the measurement which should have destroyed it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Very clever methods have been developed by people over the years to attack this issue. The idea that we will be exploring involves the use of \"ancilla\" qubits. These are qubits that are placed in the same circuit as the qubits involved in the actual computation. If the state of the qubits involved in the computation are changed through unwanted interaction with the environment, the ancilla qubits will also be changed in such a way that if we were to measure the ancilla qubits, they would give the needed information about what errors were produced in the qubits involved in computation. We would then be able to recover the states of those qubits accordingly without needing or having any information about what those states actually are. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier we will be looking at the simple (but somewhat unrealistic) case where the error produced in qubits is a complete bit flip. This corresponds to an X gate being added unwantingly to the circuit and flipping the state of the affected qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin the strategy by taking one qubit worth of information and encoding it into three actual qubits. These three qubits are known as codewords. This can be done by introducing the states $\\vert \\tilde0 \\rangle = \\vert 000 \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\tilde1 \\rangle = \\vert 111 \\rangle$. Then, a superposition of the two states can be created as $\\alpha \\vert 000 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 111 \\rangle$. One might create this state on a machine through the use of CNOT gates as shown in the below picture."

    "In this circuit the top two qubits are the ancilla qubits and the bottom three qubits are the codewords for the qubit involved in the calculation. Now suppose that $\\alpha$ is equal to 1 and $\\beta$ is equal to zero so that the initial state is $\\vert 000 \\rangle$. Depending on which qubit gets affected by the unwanted X gate (or if no qubit gets affected at all), the state can end up as one of four possibilities, $\\vert 000 \\rangle$, $\\vert 100 \\rangle$, $\\vert 010 \\rangle$, and $\\vert 001 \\rangle$. The ancilla qubits are initially in the state $\\vert 00 \\rangle$. When the three codeword qubits pass through the next four CNOT gates, one can confirm that with the four possible states of the three codeword qubits listed, the ancilla qubits will take the four possible states $\\vert 00 \\rangle$, $\\vert 10 \\rangle$, $\\vert 11 \\rangle$, and $\\vert 01 \\rangle$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazingly, these four states would appear in the same order if the initial state of the three codeword qubits was $\\vert 111 \\rangle$ instead. For example if the first of the three codeword qubits were flipped, the state of the ancilla qubits would end up as $\\vert 10 \\rangle$ whether the initial state of the three codeword qubits was $\\vert 000 \\rangle$ or $\\vert 111 \\rangle$. This means that the ancilla qubits would end up the same way for any initial superposition $\\alpha \\vert 000 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 111 \\rangle$ of the three codeword qubits again due to the linearity of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when the ancilla qubits are measured, x is the result of the first qubit and y is the result of the second qubit. These results are then used to determine how many times (either 0 or 1) each of the three codeword qubits will be flipped by another X gate. Suppose for example that the first of the three codeword qubits got flipped by an unwanted X gate in the beginning. Then the ancilla qubits would be affected so that x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 0. Then $x \\tilde y = 1$, $xy = 0$, and $\\tilde x y = 0$. This means the first codeword qubit is the only one that gets flipped at this stage, which is good since it is the first codeword qubit that received the error to begin with. One can check with this circuit that with an initial state $\\alpha \\vert 000 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 111 \\rangle$, any qubit that gets flipped by an unwanted X gate ends up getting flipped back by the final three X gates, which means this circuit succeeds in correcting for any bit flip error produced in the three codeword qubits.\n",
