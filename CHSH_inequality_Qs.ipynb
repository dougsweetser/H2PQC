    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein had issues with quantum mechanics. With Podolsky and Rosen, (particularly Podolsky) he wrote a paper in 1935 that proposed a hidden variable model with all the needed information in the past time-like light conde could predict the outcome of measurements of an entangled state (a modern term). The hidden variable model makes the same predictions as quantum mechanics when an entangled system is measured the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1964, John Bell thought carefully about an entangled system where the measurements were made independently by two observers. He focused on measurements that were not made the same way. By being \"off\" in a known way, one looks to see how correlated measurements are. Quantum mechanics predicts stronger correlations of measurements than hidden variable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt (CHSH) inequality describes a particular way to test Bell's inequality. There are two observers and two states. The name of the game is to calculate the correlation between measurements.\n",

    "Apparently there is work by Joy Christian claiming that quaternions can be used to disprove Bell's inequality. Christian's views were dismissed in [technical papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0535) and in [blogs by leaders in quantum information](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1028). The conflict apparently ended a possible career at establishment institutions, so he has set up his own.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is an unfortunate step in physics history. Let's just _do the right thing_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions are a normed division algebra. Because a complex number is a subgroup of quaternions, any and all tasks done with complex numbers will be possible with quaternions of the form (a, b, 0, 0). One needs to take small steps to generalize from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quaternion series is a vector space of quaternions with two additional pieces of information, integers for rows and columns. Quaternion series are neither normed nor a division algebra. Two quaternion series can be orthogonal, showing the norm is not preserved. There is exactly one additive identity, zero for each of the n states. There are $2^n$ multiplicative inverses for a quaternion series with each state being either zero or one. Quaternion series can be thought of as a semi-group with inverses. The author has spent some effort showing quaternion series may have enough required properties to do quantum mechanics. Given the magnitude of the subject, much remains to be done.\n",
